# food_menu
hello i am hossein abedini and i want to create the food menu project that it is a basic django project
this project shows food and you can add, update and delete items
use mysql for databse
`python3 -m venv venv` create virtual envoriment
`source venv/bin/activate` active the envoriment and you have to always do this
`pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt` install the dependency
and dont forget that i ignore the .env file and mysql password
you have to create .env file to read your mysql password in setting file
good luck...
